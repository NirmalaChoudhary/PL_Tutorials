  <th align="left" bgcolor="#CCCCCC"><h1><font color="#333333">Java Programing Language</font></h1><br />
  <P>Java is a general-purpose computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need for recompilation. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. As of 2016, Java is one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems (which has since been acquired by Oracle Corporation) and released in 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The language derives much of its syntax from C and C++, but it has fewer low-level facilities than either of them.
The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licences. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GNU General Public License. Others have also developed alternative implementations of these Sun technologies, such as the GNU Compiler for Java (bytecode compiler), GNU Classpath (standard libraries), and IcedTea-Web (browser plugin for applets).

<section id="history">
<h2><font color="#333333">History</font></h2>
<p>
James Gosling, Mike Sheridan, and Patrick Naughton initiated the Java language project in June 1991. Java was originally designed for interactive television, but it was too advanced for the digital cable television industry at the time. The language was initially called Oak after an oak tree that stood outside Gosling's office. Later the project went by the name Green and was finally renamed Java, from Java coffee. Gosling designed Java with a C/C++-style syntax that system and application programmers would find familiar.  Sun Microsystems released the first public implementation as Java 1.0 in 1995. It promised "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), providing no-cost run-times on popular platforms. Fairly secure and featuring configurable security, it allowed network- and file-access restrictions. Major web browsers soon incorporated the ability to run Java applets within web pages, and Java quickly became popular, while mostly outside of browsers, that wasn't the original plan. In January 2016, Oracle announced that Java runtime environments based on JDK 9 will discontinue the browser plugin. The Java 1.0 compiler was re-written in Java by Arthur van Hoff to comply strictly with the Java 1.0 language specification. With the advent of Java 2 (released initially as J2SE 1.2 in December 1998 – 1999), new versions had multiple configurations built for different types of platforms. J2EE included technologies and APIs for enterprise applications typically run in server environments, while J2ME featured APIs optimized for mobile applications. The desktop version was renamed J2SE. In 2006, for marketing purposes, Sun renamed new J2 versions as Java EE, Java ME, and Java SE, respectively.<br />

<section id="java platform">
<h2><font color="#333333">Java Platform</font></h2>
<p>One design goal of Java is portability, which means that programs written for the Java platform must run similarly on any combination of hardware and operating system with adequate runtime support. This is achieved by compiling the Java language code to an intermediate representation called Java bytecode, instead of directly to architecture-specific machine code. Java bytecode instructions are analogous to machine code, but they are intended to be executed by a virtual machine (VM) written specifically for the host hardware. End users commonly use a Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on their own machine for standalone Java applications, or in a web browser for Java applets.<br />

Standard libraries provide a generic way to access host-specific features such as graphics, threading, and networking.<br />

The use of universal bytecode makes porting simple. However, the overhead of interpreting bytecode into machine instructions makes interpreted programs almost always run more slowly than native executables. However, just-in-time (JIT) compilers that compile bytecodes to machine code during runtime were introduced from an early stage. Java itself is platform-independent, and is adapted to the particular platform it is to run on by a Java virtual machine for it, which translates the Java bytecode into the platform's machine language.<br />


<h2><font color="#333333">Implementations</font></h2>
Oracle Corporation is the current owner of the official implementation of the Java SE platform, following their acquisition of Sun Microsystems on January 27, 2010. This implementation is based on the original implementation of Java by Sun. The Oracle implementation is available for Microsoft Windows (still works for XP, while only later versions currently officially supported), Mac OS X, Linux and Solaris. Because Java lacks any formal standardization recognized by Ecma International, ISO/IEC, ANSI, or other third-party standards organization, the Oracle implementation is the de facto standard.<br />
The goal of Java is to make all implementations of Java compatible. Historically, Sun's trademark license for usage of the Java brand insists that all implementations be "compatible". This resulted in a legal dispute with Microsoft after Sun claimed that the Microsoft implementation did not support RMI or JNI and had added platform-specific features of their own. Sun sued in 1997, and in 2001 won a settlement of US$20 million, as well as a court order enforcing the terms of the license from Sun. As a result, Microsoft no longer ships Java with Windows.<br />
Platform-independent Java is essential to Java EE, and an even more rigorous validation is required to certify an implementation. This environment enables portable server-side applications.<br />

<h2><font color="#333333">Performance</font></h2>
Programs written in Java have a reputation for being slower and requiring more memory than those written in C++. However, Java programs' execution speed improved significantly with the introduction of just-in-time compilation in 1997/1998 for Java 1.1, the addition of language features supporting better code analysis (such as inner classes, the StringBuilder class, optional assertions, etc.), and optimizations in the Java virtual machine, such as HotSpot becoming the default for Sun's JVM in 2000. With Java 1.5, the performance was improved with the addition of the java.util.concurrent package, including Lock free implementations of the ConcurrentMaps and other multi-core collections, and it was improved further Java 1.6.

<h3>Understanding of program</h3>

Let's see what is the meaning of class, public, static, void, main, String[], System.out.println().<br />
o	<font color="#000000">class keyword</font> is used to declare a class in java.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">public </font>keyword is an access modifier which represents visibility, it means it is visible to all.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">static</font> is a keyword, if we declare any method as static, it is known as static method. The core advantage of static method is that there is no need to create object to invoke the static method. The main method is executed by the JVM, so it doesn't require to create object to invoke the main method. So it saves memory.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">void</font> is the return type of the method, it means it doesn't return any value.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">main </font>represents startup of the program.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">String[] args </font>is used for command line argument. We will learn it later.<br />
o	<font color="#000000">System.out.println() </font>is used print statement. We will learn about the internal working of System.out.println statement later.<br />

<section id="applet">
<h2><font color="#333333">Applet</font></h2>
<p>Applet is a special type of program that is embedded in the webpage to generate the dynamic content. It runs inside the browser and works at client side.<br />
<h3>Advantage of Applet</h3>
There are many advantages of applet. They are as follows:<br />
o	It works at client side so less response time.<br />
o	Secured<br />
o	It can be executed by browsers running under many plateforms, including Linux, Windows, Mac Os etc.<br />
<h3>Drawback of Applet</h3>
o	Plugin is required at client browser to execute applet.

<section id="servlet">
<h2><font color="#333333">Servlet</font></h2>
<p>
Servlet technology is used to create web application (resides at server side and generates dynamic web page).<br />
Servlet technology is robust and scalable because of java language. Before Servlet, CGI (Common Gateway Interface) scripting language was popular as a server-side programming language. But there was many disadvantages of this technology. We have discussed these disadvantages below.<br />
There are many interfaces and classes in the servlet API such as Servlet, GenericServlet, HttpServlet, ServletRequest, ServletResponse etc.
<h3>What is a Servlet?</h3>
Servlet can be described in many ways, depending on the context.
o	Servlet is a technology i.e. used to create web application.<br />
o	Servlet is an API that provides many interfaces and classes including documentations.<br />
o	Servlet is an interface that must be implemented for creating any servlet.<br />
o	Servlet is a class that extend the capabilities of the servers and respond to the incoming request. It can respond to any type of requests.<br />
o	Servlet is a web component that is deployed on the server to create dynamic web page.<br />

<section id="javaserver">
<h2><font color="#333333">Java Server Pages</font></h2>
<p>Java Server Pages (JSP) are server-side Java EE components that generate responses, typically HTML pages, to HTTP requests from clients.<br />
 JSPs embed Java code in an HTML page by using the special delimiters <% and %>.<br />
 A JSP is compiled to a Java servlet, a Java application in its own right, the first time it is accessed. After that, the generated servlet creates the response.</p>
 
 <section id="swing">
<h2><font color="#333333">Swing Application</font></h2>
<p>
Swing is a graphical user interface library for the Java SE platform. <br />
It is possible to specify a different look and feel through the pluggable look and feel system of Swing. <br />Clones of Windows, GTK+ and Motif are supplied by Sun.<br /> Apple also provides an Aqua look and feel for Mac OS X. Where prior implementations of these looks and feels may have been considered lacking, Swing in Java SE 6 addresses this problem by using more native GUI widget drawing routines of the underlying platforms.<br />
