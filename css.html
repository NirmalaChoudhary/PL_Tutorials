  <P>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language. Although most often used to set the visual style of web pages and user interfaces written in HTML and XHTML, the language can be applied to any XML document, including plain XML, SVG and XUL, and is applicable to rendering in speech, or on other media. Along with HTML and JavaScript, CSS is a cornerstone technology used by most websites to create visually engaging webpages, user interfaces for web applications, and user interfaces for many mobile applications.<br />
CSS is designed primarily to enable the separation of document content from document presentation, including aspects such as the layout, colors, and fonts. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting by specifying the relevant CSS in a separate .css file, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.<br />
Separation of formatting and content makes it possible to present the same markup page in different styles for different rendering methods, such as on-screen, in print, by voice (via speech-based browser or screen reader), and on Braille-based tactile devices. It can also display the web page differently depending on the screen size or viewing device. Readers can also specify a different style sheet, such as a CSS file stored on their own computer, to override the one the author specified.<br />
Changes to the graphic design of a document (or hundreds of documents) can be applied quickly and easily, by editing a few lines in the CSS file they use, rather than by changing markup in the documents.<br />
The CSS specification describes a priority scheme to determine which style rules apply if more than one rule matches against a particular element. In this so-called cascade, priorities (or weights) are calculated and assigned to rules, so that the results are predictable.<br />

Before Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) there was very little that could be done to change the design of a web page. While Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) creates documents for the World Wide Web, it was specifically designed to hold the content of a web page. Housed in a separate file, CSS adds the style and design to a web page. The term cascading comes from the ability to combine multiple CSS files to determine the style for one page.<br />
As more people started using HTML, the demand grew for more design capabilities, which would allow developers to control how web documents looked. But browsers offered limited capabilities for styling. In 1993 NCSA Mosaic was released, making the web more popular than ever, but it only offered limited capability to change fonts and colors.<br />
In October 1994, Tim Berners-Lee formed the World Wide Web Consortium, (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science. The W3C has members that are government entities, businesses, educational institutions and individuals. The W3C creates recommendations that are used to keep the web experience consistent among different browsers.<br />

Hakon Wium Lie released the first draft of “Cascading HTML Style Sheets” in October 1994. Brent Bos was also building Argo, a browser that had style sheets which could be used by other markup languages. In all, nine different style sheet proposals were submitted. The discussions on the www-style mailing list, which was created in May 1995, influenced the development of CSS. Because it was important to be able to use the style sheets for other markup languages, HTML was removed from the name. The W3C set up the HTML Editorial Review Board (ERB) in late 1995 to make HTML specifications.<br />

<section id="feature">
<h2><font color="#333333">Features</font></h2>
<p> <h3>1.CSS 3 Selectors</h3>
In addition to the selectors that were available in CSS2, CSS 3 introduces some new selectors. Using these selectors you can choose DOM elements based on their attributes. So you don't need to specify classes and IDs for every element. Instead, you can utilize the attribute field to style them.

<h3>2.CSS 3 Rounded Corners</h3>
Rounded corner elements can spruce up a website, but creating a rounded corner requires a designer to write a lot of code. Adjusting the height, width and positioning of these elements is a never-ending chore because any change in content can break them.
<h3>3.SS 3 Border Image</h3>
Another exciting feature in CSS 3 is the ability to swap out a border with an image. The property border-image allows you to specify an image to display instead of a plain solid-colored border.

<h3>4.CSS 3 Box Shadow</h3>
A box shadow allows you to create a drop shadow for an element. Usually this effect is achieved using a repeated image around the element. However, with the property box-shadow this can be achieved by writing a single line of CSS code.

<h3>5. CSS 3 Text Shadow</h3>
The new text-shadow property allows you to add drop shadows to the text on a webpage. Prior to CSS 3, this would be done by either using an image or duplicating a text element and then positioning it. A similar property called box-shadow is also available in CSS 3.

<h3>6. CSS 3 Gradient</h3>
While the Gradient effect is a sleek Web design tool, it can be a drain on resources if not implemented correctly using current CSS techniques. Some designers use a complete image and put in the background for the gradient effect, which increases the page load time.

<h3>7.CSS 3 RGBA: Color, Now with Opacity</h3>
The RGB property in CSS is used to set colors for different elements. CSS 3 introduces a modification and added opacity manipulation to this property. RGB has been transformed to RGBA (Red Green Blue Alpha channels), which simplifies how you control the opacity of elements.

<h3>8.CSS 3 Transform (Element Rotation)</h3>
CSS 3 also introduced a property called transform, which enables rotating Web elements on a webpage. As of now, if a designer wants to rotate of an element, he or she uses JavaScript. Many JavaScript extensions/plugins are available online for this feature, but they can make the code cumbersome and most importantly consume more resources.

 <h3>9.CSS 3 Multicolumn Layout</h3>
Almost every webpage today is divided into columns or boxes, and adjusting these boxes so they display correctly on different browsers takes a toll on Web designers. CSS 3 solves this problem with the multicolumn layout property; all you have to do is specify the number of columns you need and they will be created.
 <h3>10.CSS 3 Web Fonts</h3>
CSS 3 also facilitates embedding any custom font on a webpage. Fonts are dependent on the client system and Web pages can render only fonts that are supported by the browser or the client machine. By using the @font-face property, you can include the font from a remote location and can then use it.

<section id="limitation">
<h2><font color="#333333">Limitations</font></h2>
<p>
<h3>Selectors are unable to ascend</h3>
CSS currently offers no way to select a parent or ancestor of an element that satisfies certain criteria. CSS Selectors Level 4, which is still in Working Draft status, proposes such a selector, but only as part of the "complete" selector profile, not the "fast" profile used in dynamic CSS styling.<br /> A more advanced selector scheme (such as XPath) would enable more sophisticated style sheets. The major reasons for the CSS Working Group previously rejecting proposals for parent selectors are related to browser performance and Incremental rendering issues.
<h3>Cannot explicitly declare new scope independently of position</h3>
Scoping rules for properties such as z-index look for the closest parent element with a position:absolute or position:relative attribute. This odd coupling has undesired effects. <br />For example, it is impossible to avoid declaring a new scope when one is forced to adjust an element's position, preventing one from using the desired scope of a parent element.
<h3>Pseudo-class dynamic behavior not controllable</h3>
CSS implements pseudo-classes that allow a degree of user feedback by conditional application of alternate styles. One CSS pseudo-class, ":hover", is dynamic (equivalent of JavaScript "onmouseover") and has potential for abuse (e.g., implementing cursor-proximity popups), but CSS has no ability for a client to disable it (no "disable"-like property) or limit its effects (no "nochange"-like values for each property).
<h3>Cannot name rules</h3>
There is no way to name a CSS rule, which would allow (for example) client-side scripts to refer to the rule even if its selector changes.
<h3>Cannot include styles from a rule into another rule</h3>
CSS styles often must be duplicated in several rules to achieve a desired effect, causing additional maintenance and requiring more thorough testing. Some new CSS features were proposed to solve this, but (as of February, 2016) are not yet implemented anywhere,
<h3>Cannot target specific text without altering markup</h3>
Besides the :first-letter pseudo-element, one cannot target specific ranges of text without needing to utilize place-holder elements.

<h2><font color="#333333">Advantages</font></h2>
<p>
If you’re not using cascading style sheets in your web pages yet shame on you. CSS has excellent support in today’s browsers. It’s relatively easy to learn and produces better and cleaner code than applying all those styles directly to your HTML.<br />


Using CSS modularizes your websites in much the same way that programmers have been modularizing software code for year. Modular code in your website allows for greater design consistency and easier maintenance. CSS is the new standard and has been now for several years. It’s time to separate the structure of HTML and the presentation of CSS.<br />

So if we’ve been using HTML for years and creating all sorts of great websites with them why make the switch? Some of the advantages of using CSS are:<br />

Easier to maintain and update<br />
Greater consistency in design<br />
More formatting options<br />
Lightweight code<br />
Faster download times<br />
Search engine optimization benefits<br />
Ease of presenting different styles to different viewers<br />
Greater accessibility<br />

<h3>Separation of Style and Structure</h3>
The basic idea behind CSS is to separate the structure of a document from the presentation of the document. HTML is meant for structure. It was never intended for anything else. All those attributes you add to style your pages were added later as the viewing public demanded it. All those additions though make HTML clumsy and work against it’s main purpose of structuring a document.

<h3>Greater Control Of Presentation</h3>
CSS allows for more control over the presentation of your web pages. Given how little control web designers can sometimes have it’s nice to know there’s a way to get some of it back. Aside from the fact that CSS has more formatting options over HTML such as options to control the spacing and leading of text, CSS can also determine in what order the page itself displays. 

<h3>Search Engine Optimization</h3>
While it’s not generally agreed by everyone it’s likely that CSS can help get your pages found in a search engine. Because your CSS site contains less code and has a simpler structure it’s easier to read not only for you, but also for search engine spiders. Allowing search engine spiders to get through your code faster means your web pages can be indexed faster.<br />
